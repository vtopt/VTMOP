VTMOP -- Solver for Blackbox Multiobjective Optimization Problems
</p>
</div>

<div id="content">
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
VTMOP features two distinctly different user-interfaces, with varying
levels of flexibility.
</p>

<p>
The first and simplest user-interface is the driver subroutine
<code>VTMOP_SOLVE</code>, which is included in the module
<code>VTMOP_LIB</code>.
<code>VTMOP_SOLVE</code> accepts problem dimensions, simple bound constraints,
an objective function, some (optional) parameter settings, and (optionally) any
user-defined surrogate models and optimization routines. The default setting
is to perform an adaptive search using the VTDIRECT95 software package,
fit LSHEP surrogate models, and optimize the surrogate models using direct
search with the polling strategy generalized pattern search (GPS).
</p>

<p>
In order to use <code>VTMOP_SOLVE</code>, the blackbox multiobjective cost
function must be available as a Fortran 2008 subroutine. For information on
how to achieve this, including cases where F is an ISO C/C++ function and when
F is a command line executable, see
<a href="obj_func.html">Instructions for Writing a Blackbox Multiobjective Function for VTMOP_SOLVE</a>
Additional
information on <code>VTMOP_SOLVE</code> is provided in the comments around
each subroutine definition, in the file <code>vtmop.f90</code>.
</p>

<p>
The second interface is the return-to-caller interface, which allows
advanced users to perform function evaluations in batches, in an independent
environment. The return-to-caller interface is contained in the module
<code>VTMOP_MOD</code>, and contains four driver subroutines (below).
Additional information on these subroutines is provided in the code
documentation, in the file <code>vtmop.f90</code>.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
 <li> <code>VTMOP_INIT</code> initializes an instance of the data type
      <code>VTMOP_TYPE</code> for passing data between subroutines.
 </li>
 <li> <code>VTMOP_LTR</code> identifies the most isolated point on the Pareto
      front, constructs a local trust region (LTR) about that point, and
      returns a region of the design for the user to explore independently.
 </li>
 <li> <code>VTMOP_OPT</code> fits several surrogate models to the current
      dataset, and uses these models to propose a set of candidate points in
      the LTR, for evaluation by the user.
 </li>
 <li> <code>VTMOP_FINALIZE</code> post processes the dataset gathered
      throughout the iterations of the algorithm, returns the nondominated
      and efficient point sets, and frees all internal memory.
 </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
VTMOP also includes a checkpointing system, a detailed error handling
system, and maintains a database of all function evaluations ever taken,
which can be retrieved using optional output arrays.
</p>

<p>

<h2>Download, Build, and Test</h2>

<p>
The <a href="vtmop_toms.zip">VTMOP TOMS</a> download link contains all source
code and documentation, exactly as it appeared in
<i>ACM TOMS Algorithm 1028</i>.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="vtmop_latest.zip">VTMOP LATEST</a> download link contains the
latest version of the source code, with any modifications (none yet)
since the original ACM TOMS release.
</p>

<p>
From here on, the files <code>samples.f90</code> and <code>samplep.f90</code>
will be referred to collectively as <code>sample{s|p}.f90</code>.
</p>

<p>
To build the sample code and test the installation, use the following command,
where <code>$(F90)</code> is a Fortran 2008 compiler and <code>$(OPTS)</code>
contains the compiler options (including the option to build with OpenMP).
</p>

<p>
If BLAS and LAPACK exist on your system, then <code>$(LIBS)</code> should
contain flags to link those libraries and <code>blas.f</code> and
<code>lapack.f</code> can be removed from
the following command; otherwise, <code>$(LIBS)</code> can be ignored.

<pre>
    $(F90) $(OPTS) $(LIBS) shared_modules.f90 blas.f lapack.f slatec.f \
        qnstop.f90 sVTdirect.f90 bVTdirect.f90 delsparse.f90           \
        linear_shepard.f90 vtmop.f90 vtmop_func.f90 sample{s|p}.f90    \
        -o sample{s|p}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
To test the installation, use

<pre>
    ./sample{s|p}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Before running the parallel driver <code>samplep</code>, set the following
environment variables:

<pre>
    export OMP_NESTED=TRUE
    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=T1,T2
</pre>

where <code>T1 = MAX(NUMBER OF PROCESSORS, NUMBER OF OBJECTIVES)</code>
and <code>T2 = CEILING(NUMBER OF PROCESSORS / T1)</code>.
For the sample code provided, the number of objectives is three.
</p>

<p>
This code has been tested with the GNU 5.4.0 (and newer) and the Intel 17.0.4
Fortran compilers. Other modern Fortran compilers may not offer full support
for the Fortran 2008 standard. If using a different compiler, first check
whether it supports

<ul>
 <li>
   passing internal procedures as actual arguments
 </li>
 <li>
   usage of the <code>IEEE_ARITHMETIC</code> intrinsic module.
 </li>
</ul>
</p>

<a class="anchor" name="usage"></a>
<h2>VTMOP Full Usage Guide</h2>

<p>
VTMOP offers two interfaces for solving blackbox MOPs. They are
<ul>
 <li> the return-to-caller interface and </li>
 <li> the driver subroutine <code>VTMOP_SOLVE</code>. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In many situations, the objective function F can easily be wrapped
in a Fortran subroutine, and the driver subroutine interface is preferred
because of its ease of use. However, the return-to-caller interface offers
a flexible alternative for situations where the computing environment
makes wrapping F in a Fortran subroutine difficult or inefficient.
Both interfaces are implemented in ISO Fortran 2008 and support some forms
of OpenMP parallelism.
</p>

<p>
For information on how to implement your objective function as a Fortran
function, including cases where F is an ISO C/C++ function and when
F is a command line executable, see ``src/OBJ_FUNC_README``.
</p>

<p>
Further usage information is provided in the comments at the top of
each subroutine, in their respective source files.
</p>

<h3>The VTMOP_SOLVE Driver</h3>

<p>
The driver subroutine <code>VTMOP_SOLVE</code> implements the same process as
in the Return-to-Caller interface (below) but without reading and writing
the state and using a Fortran implementation of F.
The algorithm flowchart is shown below.
For more information on how VTMOP performs these steps, see the TOMS Algorithm
paper.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
The search phase is performed either via DIRECT or via Latin hypercube
design, with the choice being specified as an optional input.
For a search via DIRECT, the search budget inputs are used to specify
the iteration limit for VTDIRECT95. For a search via Latin hypercube
design, the search budgets are used to specify the number of points in
the design. In addition, <code>VTMOP_SOLVE</code> offers a checkpointing
system and a parallel option.
</p>

<p>
<b>Remark U.1</b>
<ul>
<li>
   When the return-to-caller interface is used, the user is expected to
   handle all function evaluation data. Indeed, this is the motivation for
   using the return-to-caller interface. Therefore, the user is also
   responsible for saving function evaluation data for checkpointing.
   The checkpointing system in VTMOP separately saves iteration
   data (such as the sequence of local trust regions (LTRs) and parameter
   settings) and function evaluation data so that the iteration data can
   still be tracked when the return-to-caller interface is used, although
   the function evaluation data is tracked only when using
   <code>VTMOP_SOLVE</code>.
   As a side effect, even when using <code>VTMOP_SOLVE</code>, the
   checkpoint files do not track which design point evaluations have been
   requested but not fulfilled. So, if an instance of <code>VTMOP_SOLVE</code>
   terminates midway through a batch of function evaluations, reloading the
   last checkpoint may result in a new sequence of evaluations.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>The Return-to-Caller Interface</h3>

<p>
In many real-world blackbox optimization problems, special
purpose computing environments and libraries for coordinating the use
of parallel resources require the evaluation of F to be decoupled
from the optimization algorithm. In these situations, it is convenient
to offer a return-to-caller interface, where F is evaluated only
from outside of any Fortran subroutine's call stack.
Here it is necessary to preserve the entire state of VTMOP's databases
and internal variables in between calls to F. The state is recorded
in a Fortran derived data type <code>VTMOP_TYPE</code>, created by the
subroutine <code>VTMOP_INIT</code>, and stored between invocations of
components of VTMOP. The cycle is as follows:
<ol>
 <li>
   <code>k -> 0</code>;
 </li>
 <li>
    <code>CALL VTMOP_INIT</code>
                    (this creates a VTMOP_TYPE structure holding the problem
                     parameters and VTMOP's state variables);
 </li>
 <li>
    <code>CALL VTMOP_LTR</code>
                    (this computes the lower and upper bounds for the next LTR);
 </li>
 <li>
    evaluate F at user-selected x-values, which are space-filling in
    the LTR returned by <code>VTMOP_LTR</code>;
 </li>
 <li>
    <code>CALL VTMOP_OPT</code>
                    (this computes the kth batch of candidate designs);
 </li>
 <li>
    evaluate the kth batch of candidate designs from <code>VTMOP_OPT</code>
    with F;
 </li>
 <li>
    <code>k -> k+1</code>;
 </li>
 <li>
    check the termination conditions (max budget or iteration limit),
    and either terminate by calling <code>VTMOP_FINALIZE</code> or return
    to Step 3.
 </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Parallel Interface</h3>

<p>
Two opportunities for parallelism are offered in VTMOP.
<ul>
 <li>
   First, the iteration tasks in the worker subroutines <code>VTMOP_LTR</code>
   and <code>VTMOP_OPT</code> can be parallelized. This includes computing
   the Delaunay graph in parallel using the parallel
   <code>DELAUNAYSPARSEP</code> driver in <code>delsparse.f90</code>,
   fitting the surrogates in parallel, and solving the
   all surrogate problems in parallel. This iteration level parallelism
   is provided via OpenMP 4.5 and is available through either the
   return-to-caller interface or the driver subroutine.
 </li>
 <li>
   The second source of parallelism is concurrently evaluating F at points
   requested by VTMOP. In the context of blackbox optimization, this is
   typically the more impactful source of parallelism. Since the
   return-to-caller interface does not evaluate F, this form of parallelism
   is available only through the driver subroutine (which offers a choice
   between iteration task parallelism, concurrent function evaluations,
   or both). Recall that VTMOP requires function evaluations only while
   searching LTRs and when evaluating candidate designs. In both cases,
   concurrent evaluations are achieved by spawning a new OpenMP task for
   each evaluation of F. Note that because the actual function evaluations
   are handled by the user, the user is also responsible for capping the
   number of actual function evaluations in order to prevent the
   oversubscription of resources.
 </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Remark U.2</b>
<ul>
 <li>
   Within a single evaluation of F, there may be ample opportunities for
   parallelism, which is problem dependent and left to the user.
   In particular, in many real-world applications, each evaluation of F
   could depend on output from a multinode, distributed simulation.
   VTMOP does not distribute calls to F, but it does provide the
   ability for concurrent evaluations of F via OpenMP task-based parallelism.
   This places the burden of distributing calls to F on the user, but it
   allows for greater flexibility.
 </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Remark U.3</b>
<ul>
 <li>
   When evaluating candidate designs and when using the Latin hypercube
   design during the search phase, all candidates/design points can be
   evaluated in parallel if enough computing resources are available.
   For a search via DIRECT, VTMOP uses a slightly modified implementation
   of VTdirect, called bVTdirect, which uses OpenMP tasks to perform
   concurrent evaluations of box centers. During a search phase, VTMOP makes
   several asynchronous calls to <code>bVTdirect</code>, resulting in
   nested parallelism.
 </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Remark U.4</b>
<ul>
<li>
   The following considerations apply only when using the DIRECT based search
   in the driver <code>VTMOP_SOLVE</code>: As described above, running
   asynchronous instances of DIRECT will result in requests for redundant
   design point evaluations, which VTMOP handles by using OpenMP task
   dependency. This means that when using <code>bVTdirect</code> during
   the search phase, many OpenMP tasks will be waiting on the completion of
   other tasks.
   As a result, the total number of OpenMP threads should be greater than
   the desired number of concurrent function evaluations so that tasks that
   are waiting will not block other designs from being evaluated.
   A general recommendation is to set the number of OpenMP level one threads
   to the desired number of concurrent function evaluations.
   (For example, if each evaluation of F requires a single node, then the
   number of level one threads should be the number of available nodes).
   This number will also be used for determining the number of concurrent
   evaluations when evaluating the candidate designs and for determining the
   number of iteration tasks that can be performed in parallel.
   If the number of total resources is greater than the number of objectives,
   then the number of level-two threads should typically be two or three.
   If the number of objectives is greater than the amount of resources,
   then a larger number of level two threads may be needed.
   In OpenMP 4.5, these values can be controlled using the
   <code>OMP_NUM_THREADS</code>
   environment variable. Use the bash command:
   
   <pre>
   export OMP_NUM_THREAD=[number of lvl 1 threads],[number of lvl 2 threads]
   </pre>

   In order to allow for nested parallelism, which is needed so that
   multiple instances of bVTdirect can run at once, the environment variable
   <code>OMP_NESTED</code> should be set to <code>true</code>.
   Use the bash command:
  
   <pre>
   export OMP_NESTED=TRUE
   </pre>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Remark U.5</b>
<ul>
<li>
   Each serial run of <code>VTMOP_SOLVE</code> is deterministic when using
   the search via DIRECT, LSHEP surrogate, and generalized pattern search
   (GPS) optimization options. For grid aligned data, however, LSHEP can
   be sensitive to the ordering of function evaluations in VTMOP's
   internal databases. Since DIRECT samples on an implicit mesh, using
   concurrent function evaluations in a run of <code>VTMOP_SOLVE</code>
   with the above settings could produce nondeterministic
   (but still reasonable) results.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Remark U.6</b>
<ul>
<li>
   The worker subroutine VTMOP_INIT accepts numerous inputs
   (many optional) when initializing the data type VTMOP_TYPE.
   Most of these inputs are further discussed in the TOMS Algorithm paper,
   and they are summarized here. The required inputs are D and P,
   which specify the number of design variables and objectives, respectively;
   and LB and UB, which specify the lower and upper bound constraints,
   respectively.

   <br>
   <br>

   The optional inputs are:
   <ul>
    <li>
      <code>DES_TOL</code> and <code>OBJ_TOL</code>, which specify the
      design space tolerance and objective space tolerance, respectively
      (by default, the square root of the working precision
      <code>EPS</code>, defined below);
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>TRUST_RADF</code>, <code>DECAY</code>, and <code>MIN_RADF</code>,
      which specify the initial trust region radius
      (as a fraction of <code>UB-LB</code>), the decay rate, and the
      minimum trust region radius (as a fraction of <code>UB-LB</code>),
      respectively (by default, 20% of each dimension of the feasible design
      space, 0.5, and 10% of the initial trust region radius fraction); 
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>EPS</code>, which specifies the working precision of the machine
      (by default, the square root of the unit round-off);
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>EPSW</code>, which specifies the fudge factor for zero weights
      (by default, the fourth root of the unit round-off);
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>LOCAL_OPT</code> and <code>LOPT_BUDGET</code>, which specify
      the procedure for performing
      local optimization and its iteration budget, respectively
      (by default, GPS with a budget of 2,500 iterations);
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>FIT_SURROGATES</code> and <code>EVAL_SURROGATES</code>,
      which specify the procedures
      for fitting and evaluating the surrogates, respectively
      (by default, wrappers for the subroutines <code>LSHEP</code> and
      <code>LSHEP_VAL</code> from SHEPPACK);
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>OBJ_BOUNDS</code>, which specifies lower and upper bounds on the
      interesting objective ranges (by default, there are no bounds);
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>PFLAG</code>, which is a Boolean value specifying whether to
      perform parallel iteration tasks (by default, <code>false</code>); and
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>ICHKPT</code>, which specifies the checkpointing mode (i.e.,
      no checkpointing, use checkpointing, or recover from checkpoint, with
      no checkpointing by default). When checkpointing is used, the
      return-to-caller interface stores its iteration data in
      <code>vtmop.chkpt</code>, and the user is responsible
      for saving function evaluation data.
    </li>
   </ul>

   <br>

   Every VTMOP subroutine also returns an integer valued error flag
   <code>IERR</code>,
   which contains zero after a successful operation or a three digit error
   code if a failure occurs. The specific error codes are contained in
   the comments above each subroutine definition.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Remark U.7</b>
<ul>
<li>
   The driver <code>VTMOP_SOLVE</code> accepts all of the inputs described in
   Remark U.6 except <code>PFLAG</code>, which is replaced by an integer
   <code>PMODE</code>, specifying
   whether to use iteration parallelism, parallelism between function
   evaluations, or both (by default, neither). Also, when checkpointing
   is used, <code>VTMOP_SOLVE</code> stores function evaluation data in a
   second checkpointing file, <code>vtmop.dat</code>.
   In addition to the inputs in Remark U.6, <code>VTMOP_SOLVE</code> requires
   a subroutine <code>OBJ_FUNC</code> that evaluates the blackbox
   multiobjective function F; and <code>VTMOP_SOLVE</code> returns
   <code>EFFICIENT_X</code> and <code>PARETO_F</code>, containing the
   efficient and nondominated sets, respectively.
   Additional optional arguments for <code>VTMOP_SOLVE</code> are as follows.
   <ul>
    <li>
      <code>ADAPTIVE_SEARCH</code> is a Boolean variable that specifies
      whether the search via DIRECT should be used when true, as opposed
      to the Latin hypercube search when false (by default, <code>true</code>).
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>BB_BUDGET</code> is the limit on the number of blackbox function
      evaluations (i.e., evaluations of F, by default, 1,000).
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>MAXITERS</code> is the iteration limit for <code>VTMOP_SOLVE</code>
      (by default, unlimited).
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>INITIAL_SBUDGET</codE> and <code>SEARCH_BUDGET</code> are the
      budget per search when <code>k=0</code> and <code>k>0</code>,
      respectively -- when <code>ADAPTIVE_SEARCH</code> is <code>true</code>,
      the search budgets specify the number of iterations for DIRECT
      (by default, 10 and 5, respectively); otherwise, they specify the
      number of points in each Latin hypercube design (by default,
      <code>16*D^2</code> and <code>8*D</code>, respectively).
    </li>
    <li>
      On input, <code>DES_PTS</code> and <code>OBJ_PTS</code> can be used
      to specify the initial databases of precomputed function values; and
      on output, they will be reallocated and used to return the final database
      of all function evaluations.
    </li>
   </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Remark U.8</b>
<ul>
<li>
   VTMOP allows for certain optional inputs to be changed after recovering
   from a checkpoint. Therefore, the following optional inputs are not
   saved when checkpointing is active; they must be resupplied by the user
   if nondefault values are required:
   <ul>
    <li><code>LOPT_BUDGET</code>,</li>
    <li><code>LOCAL_OPT</code>,</li>
    <li><code>FIT_SURROGATES</code>,</li>
    <li><code>EVAL_SURROGATES</code>,</li>
    <li><code>PMODE/PFLAG</code>,</li>
    <li><code>ADAPTIVE_SEARCH</code>,</li>
    <li><code>BB_BUDGET</code>,</li>
    <li><code>MAXITERS</code>,</li>
    <li><code>INITIALS_BUDGET</code>,</li>
    <li><code>SEARCH_BUDGET</code>,</li>
    <li><code>DES_PTS</code>, and</li>
    <li><code>OBJ_PTS</code>.</li>
   </ul>
</li>
</ul>

   The cost of each search phase can get out of hand if one is not
   mindful of the interplay between <code>INITIAL_SBUDGET</code> and
   <code>SEARCH_BUDGET</code> and <code>D</code> when using the setting

   setting <code>ADAPTIVE_SEARCH=.FALSE.</code> is the better choice.
